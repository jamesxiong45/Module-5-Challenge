# Description

Upon entering the website, you are greeted and reminded of the current time and date.

The website allows you to create a schedule and keeps track of time by indicating the past, present, and future hours with different colors.

You can do so by typing into the timeblocks and clicking the blue save button on the right for the each hour of the day.
